## Distributed System
Distributed system is a system in which s/w and h/w components are connected in a network which communicate only by passing message.

Ex: Internet

- Industrial control system 
- Cloud Computing 

## Type of transparency in DS
**Transparency in DS** : Internal detail are hidden from users.

**Type of transparency**
- **Access Transparency**:
Users can access resources in a distributed system without knowing how the access is implemented (local or remote, file or database).

- **Location Transparency**:
Users donâ€™t need to know where a resource is physically located; they use the same method to access it regardless of its location.

- **Concurrency Transparency**:
Multiple users can access resources at the same time without interfering with each other or noticing conflicts.

- **Replication Transparency**:
Users are unaware that multiple copies of a resource exist; the system manages all copies automatically.

- **Failure Transparency**:
The system hides failures (like server crashes) from users, so things keep working or recover smoothly.

- **Performance Transparency**:
The system automatically adapts to load or resource changes, so users experience consistent performance.
