## Data Structure
### What is a data structure?
- A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

### Why learn Data structure?
- almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way.
- To efficiently manage the data, you need data structure
- Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient organization of the book and they are stored randomly.

- The difference between a function taking a few milli seconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure.
- Data structure help you to solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory

- Learning about data structures also help you gain a more profound understanding of things you're already aware of 
    - DOM - Tree Data Structure
    - Browser back and forward - Stack data structure
    - OS Job Scheduling - Queue data structure

Build in Data structure

- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

Custom Data structures
- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular Queues
- linked lists
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs

### Array
- An array is a data structure that can hold a collection of values.
- Arrays can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same array.
- Array are resizable. You don't have to declare the size of an array before creating it.
- Javascript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertion order is maintained
- Arrays are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.
