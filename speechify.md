*   **Intentional Relationship Building:** Cliff is "incredibly intentional about the relationship in his life".
*   **Proactive Outreach (Cold Messaging):**
    *   Actively **cold emails and messages people** (founders, experts, inspiring individuals) on various platforms.
    *   **Persistence is key**: Willing to message someone up to eight times before they respond, without fear of being a "double-texter".
    *   **Simple message structure:** Express admiration for their work, establish some credibility (e.g., "I'm a student at Brown"), express desire to be friends, and suggest specific times for a call. This approach yields an **80% success rate** for calls.
*   **Networking in Practice:**
    *   **"Three dinners a night"** in college dining halls to meet 60% of his freshman class in two months.
    *   Practiced **"comfort challenges"** (e.g., smiling at strangers, negotiating discounts, asking people out) to overcome shyness and build social muscle.
    *   Actively participates in diverse activities (hackathons, rap battles, sports) to meet people.
    *   **Identifies the top 100 experts** in a field via Google Sheets and messages all of them.
    *   **Prioritises in-person meetings**, even flying to different cities or countries to connect with people he admires.
    *   **Views his CEO role as "collecting incredible people"** and having them align on a big vision.
*   **Motivation for Networking:** Driven by a desire to be his best self, to give and receive love, and to create value in the world. He seeks to learn from the "most awesome people in the world".
*   **Maintaining Connections:**
    *   **Sends gratitude notes to people he loves**, especially when procrastinating, as a positive alternative to social media scrolling. This helps maintain connections even if not close in person.
    *   **Books social engagements well in advance** (e.g., a month or more for friends).
    *   **Actively fosters camaraderie** (e.g., encouraging friends to move in, even paying for lease breaks).
*   **Scheduling Flexibility:** Cliff's calendar is typically "fully blocked" for weeks in advance, but he maintains flexibility for high-energy opportunities or connecting with inspiring people. He doesn't allow others to book time on his calendar.
*   **Prioritising Relationships Financially:** He is frugal but will spend without looking at prices on high-quality food, Ubers to friends, or flights to meet people for his wellbeing and growth. He also applies this to buying thoughtful gifts.
*   **Deep Conversation:** Skips small talk in favour of **vulnerability or ambition-based conversations** (e.g., "What's your biggest struggle?", "Top three goals," "What gives you energy?") to quickly form meaningful connections.

### IV. Personal Growth & Philosophy

*   **Ambitious Mindset:** From a young age, Cliff believed he "could do anything" and that this belief "just never happened to me" (i.e., he never lost it). He feels an inner "fire in my chest".
*   **Founder-Product Fit:** Believes this is more crucial than product-market fit. It means aligning one's work with a problem the founder personally and deeply understands, creating a unique advantage.
*   **The Principle of Giving:**
